    <h1>Hello World!</h1>
    <p>My name is Ryan Thomas.</p>

    <!-- What I did before CodeWorks -->
    <p>Before CodeWorks, I spent most of my life as a musician. I went to both Boise State University and
        Univeristy of Idaho for my degrees in music and, after graduating, worked on a cruise ship for four years.
     My coding experience has been quite limited (from brushing up on various programming languages
     to spending about the past year developing a couple of games as a hobby).</p>

    <!-- What I hope to get out of this course -->
    <p>I am ready for the challenges that will come with this field, and I am excited to start a brand new career and meet new people.
         I am excited to have the chance to dive into this field, start fresh and learn valuable skills. I plan
         to keep my career options open, but depending on my position, I would appreciate the opportunity to be able to
         work remotely if I plan to travel often.
    </p>

    <!-- Things I enjoy -->
    <p>In addition to music, I thoroughly enjoy traveling, skiing, and working with computers. In addition,
         I am currently learning Spanish as a second language, both because I have always wanted to be
         able to speak another language fluently, and my girlfriend currently lives in Barcelona. I would
         like to be able to converse with her family more effectively.
    </p>
